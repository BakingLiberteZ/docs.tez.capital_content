## Tezos proposal voting

The Tezos proposal process consists of 5 stages, each of which lasts for 5 cycles (~14 days). Briefly, the proposal process is as follows:
1. *Proposal.* If no proposal gets more than 5% of the state to vote for it, the proposal process repeats indefinitely. As soon as a proposal gets 5% of the state to vote for it, the proposal process moves to the next stage. In cases where there are multiple 5%+ proposals on the table, the proposal with the most votes wins.
2. *Exploration* Proposal needs to hit quorum (around 50% of all stake voting in some way) and it needs to further hit an acceptance level of 80%+. If it fails to meet these thresholds, the process resets back to the *Proposal* stage.
3. *Cooldown* The proposal is tested on a dedicated test network to make sure it migrates and runs. Dapp developers make sure this proposal doesn't break their dapps.
4. *Promotion* Proposal needs to hit quorum (around 50% of all stake voting in some way) and it needs to further hit an acceptance level of 80%+. If it fails to meet these thresholds, the process resets back to the *Proposal* stage.
5. *Adoption* The proposal is officially accepted and goes into effect at the end of the *Adoption* stage. The Ghostnet test network is upgraded as a final test before Mainnet adoption. Dapp developers make sure this proposal doesn't break their dapps and make any necessary changes to their dapps.

## Proposal voting with TezGov

TezGov allows you to participate in Tezos proposal voting with your Ledger hardware wallet. 

* We recommend using a secondary Ledger device with the same seed, to vote with while your primary device is baking. 
* You can also briefly unplug your primary Ledger baking device and use it on a different computer just for voting purposes (use the wallet app to vote), then immediately plugging it back into the primary device, opening the baking app and resuming baking only.
* If your baking computer itself has a graphical interface, you can briefly switch to the wallet app on your Ledger device and vote, then switch back to the baking app and resume baking only.
